## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

You cannot overlap a color directly with a background image, you have to use a gradient.

```css
.card__img {
  background-image: linear-gradient($overlay), url(../images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
}
```
